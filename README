 Author: Dibyendu Das

 Instruction
--------------
	This application is web based. It takes a phrase from the user & searches
a couple of dictionary servers through their public api, parses the retrieved
data from json/xml format to readable format & displays in a window.
	It currently supports two languages : English (being an international language) &
					      Bengali (being my native language)
